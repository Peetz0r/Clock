# Clock
A nice webbased linear clock.

Inspired by a flash clock which I must have seen somewhere in the 2000s, then haven't seen for years, then recreated in plain HTML in the early 2010s.

Much later, in 2022, I found the original again, at http://web.archive.org/web/20050205020758/http://www.designegg.com/insertmonkey/clock.html (and a variant at http://beeks.eu/swf/timeline.swf).

If you want to see those original clocks without having to install the mess that is ~~Adobe~~ Macromedia Flash Player, then you can go to https://ruffle.rs/demo/ and stick one of those SWF files in there.

To be sure they don't get lost again, I'll stick the SWF files in here too.
